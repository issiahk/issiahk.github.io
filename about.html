                <h1>About the ISSIA</h1>


                <p> ISSIA (Inter-school Social Issues Association) is an international, youth-led non-profit based in Hong
                    Kong. We aim to create a network and collaborative platform for discourse on social issues. Currently, ISSIA has over 200+ active staff members from 40+ schools throughout Hong Kong. 
                    In addition, we have also expanded internationally, with contributors from 10+ Countries.  We have been featured on the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/yp/report/latest-reports/article/3096723/climate-activists-asian-representation-and-racism-these">SCMP Young Post</a>, RTHK Radio 3,  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHFNW57ngpe/">Pixl Media</a> and the <a href="https://www.arianalife.com/topics/initiatives/youth-in-focus-students-helping-students-in-hong-kong/">Ariana Magazine</a>.  
                    Lastly, we spoke at the Hong Kong Youth Summit (Hong Kong Mental Health Conference) and was awarded a $3000HKD grant from Kids4Kids to expand our flagship ISSIA magazine.


                </p>

                <p>
                    We produce a variety of multimedia content, including magazines, podcasts, webinars, surveys and
                    videos. This year, we have launched a series of events and programmes (e.g. the  ISSIA Youth NGOS Forum, ISSIAMUN, ISSIA Debate Programme).
                    We have also launched 10+ school chapters throughout Hong Kong.

                </p>

                <p> ISSIA prides itself on having an active community and network of passionate individuals, all working
                    to shed light on pressing issues and providing an inclusive platform for social engagement and
                    student voice; the notion of civil discourse has never been more important and is central to our
                    driving ethos - one we will continue to uphold. We also aim to address educational inequality by bridging
                    opportunities between local and international schools, promoting a culture of socially consciousness and 
                    creating the leaders for tomorrow.
                </p>

                <p><b>ISSIA Magazine</b></p>

                <p>
                    Our newly launched magazine serves as a microcosm of ISSIA’s mission to provide a collaborative platform for discourse on social issues. 
                    At 95 pages, we feature a plethora of student work, ranging from articles and poems, to student artwork and photography submissions 
                    across Hong Kong. We discuss LGBTQ+ Identity in Hong Kong, mental health, restorative justice, capitalism, gentrification, foreign domestic workers, refugees and more!  
                    You can find the first edition <a href="https://issuu.com/issiahk/docs/issia_issue_1_-_digital_final">here.</a>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>ISSIA Podcast</b>
                </p>

                <p> In addition to the magazine, we also have a weekly podcast programme in which contributors discuss
                    contentious topics ranging from social apathy in Hong Kong to intersectional feminism. We also
                    discuss academic topics e.g. nihilism, economic systems and more! We have published 10+ podcasts.
                </p>

                <p><b>ISSIA Online</b></p>

                <p> Our online media publication (issiahk.org) serves as the base for our multimedia content and the main website for
                    ISSIA. We also introduced “ISSIA Weekly”, a weekly roundup of select articles from ISSIA Online! We 
                    have published over 140 articles on issiahk.org, with more to come.
                </p>

                <p><b>ISSIA Research</b></p>

                <p> We have conducted comprehensive surveys, investigating social engagement in high school students in
                    Hong Kong (100+ respondents). Our second survey focused on and the effects of COVID-19 on student
                    wellbeing and student opinion on online learning (60+ respondents).

                <p><b>New Initatives and Projects</b></p>

                </p>
                <p><b>ISSIA Events</b></p>

                <p> We recently hosted ISSIA's first 'Youth NGOS Forum'. Through the event, we hope to foster a greater sense of connectivity between different youth organizations as well as increase exposure for ongoing projects and opportunities. 
                    The event connected 10+ Youth NGOS through a variety of events including a panel (featuring AliveVibe, ReBooked and Colour Away Covid), skill-based workshops, networking events and more.

                </p>
                
                <p> We also organized our own Model United Nations conference (ISSIAMUN), where we had two councils (ECOSOC, US Senate), introducing the topic of Black Lives Matter and the aftermath of Colonialism to ~40 students from a variety of schools in Hong Kong.
               
                </p>
                <p><b>Multimedia Team</b></p>

                <p> We are expanding our multimedia coverage. We are working on a documentary series, diversifying the content for our podcasts
                    and expanding our research and advocacy efforts.

                </p>

                <p><b>Outreach</b></p>

                <p> We have three main areas of expansion 1) local schools 2) universities 3) international recruitment. 
                    We are looking to expand on all three fronts, helping make our community even more diverse!
