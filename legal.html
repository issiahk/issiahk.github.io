                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>Thank you for visiting our website!</p>
                <p>At ISSIA HK (Inter-school Social Issues Association), your privacy is critically important to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ISSIA HK operates issiahk.org. It is ISSIA HK’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any
                    information we may collect while operating our website and our organization. This Privacy Policy
                    Statement tells you about what information we would collect from you, what we would do about them
                    and also explains our security policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us directly at
                    issiaofficial@gmail.com
                </p>

                <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

                <p>Like most website operators, ISSIA HK collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                    that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                    preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ISSIA HK’s purpose in
                    collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ISSIA HK’s visitors
                    use its website. From time to time, ISSIA HK may release non-personally-identifying information in
                    the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

                <p>ISSIA HK also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. ISSIA HK only discloses logged in user
                    and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                    personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are
                    visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
