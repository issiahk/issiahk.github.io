                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Introduction -- What exactly is genetic engineering?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Genetic engineering is simply the process of altering the DNA of an organism in order to change the way it behaves, looks like, or reacts with certain things. The purpose of genetic engineering is to enhance characteristics of certain organisms, such as making plants more nutritious. It is a modern technology manipulated by biologists and engineers since 1973, when a bacterium was genetically modified. Genetic engineering was used to mass produce human insulin in bacteria earlier on; but now, people use it for various purposes, from altering human growth hormones, follicle stimulating hormones, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and other drugs. In this article, the main purpose is to discuss whether human genetic engineering is ethical, therefore detailed scientific knowledge will not be included. I will investigate whether genetic engineering on babies (‘Designer babies’) should be accepted by the public.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Section one: Designer babies</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; ">What, and why?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">A designer baby is a baby that has been given special traits through genetic engineering. Sometimes the genes that associate with diseases may be removed, while at other times people alter the genetic makeup in order to achieve effects such as having a smarter child. People can alter genes in parents’ sex cells or even in the embryo, though the process is sometimes illegal. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The main reason to change the genetic information in an infant is to improve its life characteristics, for example ensuring it will not be born with any genetic diseases, or to simply make the baby ‘smarter’ and ‘better’ than the others out of competitiveness and personal desires. Genetic diseases from HIV to haemophilia are often fatal if infected, so by genetic modification, perhaps less people would be adversely affected by such fatal diseases. Other than that, in this modern society, competition is more frequent than ever. People yearn to compare their kids with others and are delighted to hear their child exceeding others of the same age in certain aspects. With this technology available, people with wealth can ‘create’ a bright and outstanding baby for them to show off.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; ">Is it really that beneficial?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Although people have been working on this technology for a long time, we still have to admit that the modification of genetic material, especially in humans, is a newly explored area. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Let’s analyse this biologically first. To get us started with, let’s talk about whether it could help the prevention of genetic diseases. David Sinclair, a specialist, mentioned that the editing of a gene can help remove the lethal gene defect from an egg cell, to help prevent kids from getting diseases such as Huntington’s disease. With a reduced chance of being infected with fatal diseases, better public health can be ensured within the society while lessening the worries of the family members. However, we should acknowledge that it is at times impossible to ensure that someone will never be infected with a genetic disease, even after gene modification. DNA mutations may cause rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, but selecting embryos that do not have these mutations means not they will never catch the disease -- it simply means you are cutting off just one possible cause of it. People often underestimate the power of diseases and think that they can prevent them from sparking up simply by throwing a few more bucks to the hospital. Health is as unpredictable as the weather, and one’s genetic coding isn’t not the only factor.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Next, let’s talk briefly about whether genetic engineering can improve one’s character traits. According to Shai Carmi, whose lab studies statistical and population genetics at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that the gains from genetic engineering are rather limited. According to his team’s models, embryos screened for height-enhancing genes may gain only about 3 centimeters of height on average, and those screened for intellect may gain only about 3.0 IQ points on average. The results do occur, but the effects are rather minimal. And indeed positive results may be obtained, but safety concerns arise from the process as well. In the late 1990s, scientists discovered a gene that is linked to memory. Modifying this gene in mice greatly improved their learning and memory, but also increased their perception of pain. Kids whose genes are altered may end up with unpleasant characteristics. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Now let’s move onto ethics. If the technology is someday proven to be completely safe, maybe some think that parents have the right to opt for it, as long as they can afford the enormous fee. Since the surgery, initially, affects only the child himself/herself, but will not pose threats to other members of the society unless potentially dangerous traits are requested. If the parents stick to the rules and simply pay to alter genes related to illnesses, it will help improve the kid’s health while not adversely affecting anyone else’s life. The benefits may seem more apparent than the harm in this case.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">But let’s consider other factors as well. One, parents alternate their babies’ genes without getting their consent. Will the children grow up to dislike their parents for making such a decision that puts them in more pain than usual, if the surgery fails? What if the child prefers being ‘ordinary’? The whole idea of genetic engineering simply doesn’t cater for patients’ opinions. The surgery will affect the child for the entire lifetime. Should parents be granted the freedom to make such an impactful decision for their kids? Indeed some may argue that it is inevitable for parents to help make decisions for their children just as they always do, but when we dig a little deeper and think about it -- genetic modification will completely change the child. It is unlike a trivial decision such as to let the child play basketball, since the latter will not affect their entire life nor will it alter the child’s looks, chances of getting genetic illnesses, personality, etc. Receiving genetic operations is perhaps the biggest decision that will ever be made for the child. Do parents really have the right to intervene with the whole life of the child -- as the impacts will last long after adulthood, after when guardians can no longer make important choices for their children?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; ">In terms of whether or not it will affect other members of the society, the details will be discussed below.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Controversy 2: Does it help the society?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Altering the gene mutations that may lead to sickness can help reduce the number of cases of genetic diseases in the society. With less people affected by these illnesses, less public medical resources will be needed to cure patients with them. It is found that the fraction of people with mutations linked to genetic diseases is at something closer to 20 percent, which is a lot; and if technology can be blended into the situation to help lower the rate of infection, resources can be saved and reallocated for other uses.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">However, the upsurge of genetic modification operations may lead to other more serious issues. The first one is that it will exacerbate the problem of wealth disparity. Due to the fact that DNA modification is a rather new scientific advancement, the cost of getting a designer baby will be high since cheaper alternate methods are not invented yet. Only the rich are able to afford it. Does this mean that the wealthy can get their children out of suffering from genetic diseases and may even have brighter and prettier kids than the poor? With a more capable brain and higher intelligence, kids can learn significantly better than those who cannot memorise well. In a society where academic results are very important when it comes to job searching, will the poorer kids whose parents’ couldn’t afford DNA modification be at a disadvantaged position? Since genetic modification can potentially improve people’s lives, but should personalities be monetized? If we are ‘selling’ character traits, are we getting ourselves ready for the uprising of human merchandising in the future?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Imagine living in an artificial world in a few decades’ time, in which babies are made and sold like marketable goods. Everyone is flawless, beautiful, bright, just like computers. Or just like the beautiful branded goods you see in the mall. Allowing room for genetic modification is implicitly turning infants into products. You can pay for the traits you want, you can pay for better health… In that world, humans are no different from robots. Naturalness and integrity are  what define us as an individual, and our flaws make us unique as well. Our individuality is more important than good looks and smartness.</span></p><p></p>
