                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The digital divide in Hong Kong is often overlooked by the public, amplified only by the pandemic when students are forced to switch from physical classrooms to online platforms like Google Classroom, Zoom, and Schoology. The accessibility of digital devices is relatively lower in low-income families, which may affect student’s learning progress, widening the gap in education level between students from families of different socio-economic statuses. The digital learning era is not ending soon for as far as we know, hence the problem of digital divide must be addressed. As potential Young Envoys of UNICEF, we plan to raise awareness of digital inequality in this passage and provide feasible solutions to the issue.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">We have designed individual questionnaires for 3 groups of stakeholders, namely students, parents, and teachers from direct subsidy scheme (DSS)  and government schools, in hope to understand their personal experiences and knowledge of the digital gap, and the extent of its influence to students from families of different status. In terms of parental support, our survey finds that 65% of parents receiving financial subsidies are unable to assist their children with online learning. Contrarily, 28% of parents who do not receive any subsidies are unable to assist their children. This illustrates a striking contrast between the family support received by students with different socio-economic statuses, exemplifying the severity of digital inequality in Hong Kong. Our survey finds that 94.1% of students have encountered difficulties such as lack of concentration and poor internet connection during online classes. However, only 27.2% of students in low-income families and 52.5% of students in middle- and high-income families believed their parents could assist them when they encountered difficulties with online learning. Only 36.3% of students think that online learning has brought positive changes to their academic performances, showing online learning mostly negatively affects students’ studies despite different family backgrounds. However, students from more well-off families tend to receive more support from parents, thus showing better academic performances. Similar difficulties have been encountered by interviewed teachers. Regardless of school types, over 73% teachers have had unstable networks and noisy backgrounds during online lessons. Teachers serving in aided or government schools were less proficient with online teachings when compared to the teachers serving in DSS schools. Multiple responses reflect that schools had provided more subsidies and support than the government. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The quality of education received through online classes depends very much on household financial strengths such as computing equipment and a decent working environment, as well as technical efficiency of teachers. Under this circumstance, all members of society need to be aware of the difficulties faced by children from poor families. As responsible citizens, we should all work hand in hand to create a more equal environment in which each student can unleash their full potential through education. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">To improve digital accessibility, students who require additional attention should be allowed to apply for a subsidized computer and broadband bundle to support their home-based learning. In particular,  households with difficulties installing fiber connection should be subsidized to opt for mobile broadband instead and families with three or more school-going children may receive a second computer. In addition, schools and teachers should pay acute attention to spotting students in need and introducing the above measures to them. Schools and teachers can also help to provide support for parenting in the digital age. As most parents are not digital natives, it is hard for them to provide necessary assistance to their children. Online learning inevitably lowers the learning incentives and is much more difficult for underprivileged students to learn. Online tutorial sessions and study groups can be organized by community centers for students who lack parental guidance and self-discipline. These workshops can help them to catch up with school schedules.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Launched by UNICEF HK since 1996, UNICEF Young Envoys Programme aims to cultivate teenage child rights advocates by allowing us Young Envoys to explore global and local issues in relation to children’s rights to survival, protection, development and participation. As we have been unable to travel abroad to conduct volunteer work, we apt our focus to current problems of local kids this year by conducting virtual workshops and promotions.
