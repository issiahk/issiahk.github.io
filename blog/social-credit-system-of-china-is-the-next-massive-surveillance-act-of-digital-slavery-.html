                <p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Democracy stands for liberal values and advocacy of human rights. Humans are able to unite and perform selfless acts of benevolence. However, human rights are gradually being breached by a myriad of governments. Peace, privacy, personal dignity and security are questioned today. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">A country, after all, is something that we build every single day out of certain basic shared values - universal values based on democracy, human rights, gender equality and labor rights, liberty and freedom of expression. How can we ensure a healthy future for our nations if many governments derive their citizens of liberty and involve their citizens into implicit violation of human rights? </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Nowadays, the social credit system is becoming a successfully implemented tool of local government policies involving the financial system, judicial system and social system. But if we get into details, this instrument thoroughly controls nationals’ behavior within the country. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Take Mainland China as an example. Their program of social credit system claimed that it helps regulate social behavior, improve the "trustworthiness" which includes paying taxes and bills on time, and promoting traditional moral values. In other words, it is a unified record system for the government to track individuals and businesses. Doesn’t this tool resemble China’s surveillance system, Skynet, which comprises facial recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data? Admittedly, it serves not just as a tool but a crucial act of illicit human rights violation - mass surveillance. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Wide sweeping surveillance programs are becoming a massively comprehensive tool of governments treating people in an inhuman, degrading way. Governments are using sophisticated technology in order to read human rights activists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ microphones and cameras to secretly record their activities. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">AI surveillance tools are rapidly proliferating around the globe in order to track, monitor and surveil citizens. The initial goal of artificial intelligence was to “make machines intelligent”, but it turned out to go beyond further individual customer choices, beginning to transform basic patterns of governance by providing governments with unprecedented capabilities to monitor their citizens and shape their choices. Moreover, AI gave us a new capacity to disrupt elections, elevate false information, and delegitimize democratic discourse across borders. AI surveillance is a new approach to advance political goals, and facial recognition and big data platforms are great practical tools to anticipate the algorithms of policy making.  </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">China, in particular, has been watching activists who protect labor rights or prohibiting NGOs activities for the sake of promoting human rights in order to control the nation's potential behavior better. Many Chinese activists were accused of disturbing social order, simply because they were protecting basic human rights. Articles on this sort of assault and victimization vanish, and the social media accounts (for instance, WeChat) of these human activists are blocked. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">In this century, digital surveillance appears to have become a new weapon of spreading digital slavery. And, social credit systems are a small part of this race for power and control. We haven’t realized how our privacy has become a luxury for us, and a target for governments. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Social scores are penetrating into our lives; buying goods on eBay, or rating your Uber driver, is becoming a part of the social credit system. Unconsciously, by using services and providing our personal information, we allow governments to check, analyze, and evaluate our behaviour; to control us. The Chinese government achieves complete control over its citizens by checking which bills are paid so that they may restrict the rights to purchase the tickets later and your further movement. By implementing such social credits, the government collects power and makes its citizens not free people, but slaves.  </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Unsurprisingly, the AI Global Surveillance Index shows that countries with low levels of political rights are investing heavily in AI surveillance technologies (facial recognition cameras, analytic systems and monitoring capabilities). China is a major supplier, and technology company Huawei alone provides their AI surveillance technology to at least 50 countries. Strangely, liberal democracies are recently becoming major users of AI surveillance as well. The index shows that 51 percent of advanced democracies deploy AI surveillance systems. Liberal, democratic governments also aggressively use AI tools to police borders, apprehend potential criminals, monitor citizens for bad behavior, and pull out suspected terrorists from crowds. This isn’t necessarily illegal, however; more and more advanced democracies struggle to balance security interests with protection of civil liberties. There is an obvious point to be made here. All these actions profoundly affect an individual’s right to privacy.  </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">There is also a question. If we live in a democratic society, how did we allow our governments to control us, breaching our human rights? How did we let governments penetrate our privacy, break our security?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">There should be a proper balance between AI technology, government surveillance, and the privacy rights of citizens. We are in need of liberal and democratic society that doesn’t claim to adopt a social credit system which satisfies governments’ lucrative interests. This is an obvious red line, and we should decide if we allow it to be crossed - or if it is still possible to build a society where security exists. Do we participate in politics of cynicism, or do we participate in politics of hope? How blessed are we, to make the right choice? You decide. </span></p><p></p>
