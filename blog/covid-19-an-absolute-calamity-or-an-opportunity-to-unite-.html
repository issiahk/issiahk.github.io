                <p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">During this global pandemic, we are all confined within the walls of uncertainty and infirmities, however, do we have to live behind these barriers alone? </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">We, as a species have been designed to overcome multiple afflictions that have greeted us, we have evolved to a point where we can adapt to any circumstance that befalls us. So, why can’t we endure this, together? Because the one thing that gives us our power has been taken away from us; our ability to physically interact, to socialize with others. In fact, Steve Jobs once said: “technology alone is not enough”, as integrated thinking is highly beneficial for the solution of our existing problems. However, even with our struggles to interact with each other whilst following the ‘6 feet apart’ rule and having our masks acting as a barrier between human interconnection, we have taken this as an opportunity to demonstrate our persistence. Astonishingly, whilst us homosapiens are most fearful of change, we are also the most adaptable species. Not only have we merely survived the circumstances but we have flourishingly acclimatized through the usage of webinars, online support groups, online classes, etc. Hence, due to the rapid advancement of technology and innovation, we have collectively accommodated to a rather unfavourable situation through a number of creative ideas and cultural changes. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Firstly, the thick border that once existed between individualistic and collectivist cultures has begun to weaken. Whilst an individualist culture encourages self-expression and individuality over group goals, a collectivistic culture values self-sacrifice for the general community well-being. Despite the fact that prior to COVID-19, America and Europe were largely known as independent, individualistic cultures, the recent circumstances have caused them to somewhat adapt to the ideals of a collectivist culture. During this quarantine period, citizens not only from collectivistic cultures but individuals from all around the world are persistently helping those around them, assisting the neighbours they once bore no connection to. The very neighbours which we once classified merely by house number and surname are the same ones we now offer to buy groceries for or call to check on their well-being.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Moreover, although the clapping movement began in Italy, residents from various countries gather in their balconies to display their gratitude and appreciation for those risking their lives for us. Not only that but, people ranging from teenagers to Millennials to adults are participating in new trends such as ‘Netflix party’, ‘Until Tomorrow’ and daily challenges. Whether it is a cooking challenge or workout challenge, the ultimate objective is to create a sense of interconnection between those in both, a physical and mental state of solitary. Prior to COVID-19, the modern lifestyle was slowly disconnecting us from our family and our true values. We were so caught up in our own tangential matters, we unknowingly began to fall in the bleak traps of materialism which were sneakily hidden behind the facade of happiness. However, the current conditions have in a way, humanized us, forcing us to place our focus on our principals, on the aspects of life that truly matter. Whilst many may struggle to be suddenly put in a situation to conventionally communicate with their family, this is a great opportunity to build bridges and heal the fractured bonds. However, after the termination of the virus, we can only wonder whether these newfound cultural and positive personality changes will sustain or if we will return to our self-centred, overburdened lives. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Furthermore, the mental segregations that once divided the people across the globe now hold minimal importance. The leverages that were once held against each other are now insignificant as the face of the virus has no eyes. You cannot bribe the virus with your status quo, wealth, intellect or what society defines as a ‘beautiful face’. Each and everyone one of us must endure the same restlessness, the same worries. Whilst, of course, this period may be easier for some than for others due to any domination we may have in any aspect, at the end of the day we are all faced with the same difficulties. Likewise, despite being situated in various parts of the world, ultimately we all exist under the same blue sky. Therefore, the presence of this invisible, lethal enemy has unified us, reminding us of the inevitable end of our lives and thus, the irrelevance of the divisions in our community. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">To conclude, although COVID-19 is having numerous unwanted effects including, the upcoming global economic recession, rising unemployment levels, soaring anxiety levels and of course, thousands of deaths, we can withstand this, together. Whilst, of course, these new forms of unity have been a wonderful new precedent, the xenophobia and blame that has been packaged with it is steadily diminishing our newfound unification. Despite our vast difficulties at the present moment including the growing xenophobia which is arguably disuniting us, this virus shouldn’t be a phase we are forced to stoically endure. Perhaps by reducing the various forms of discrimination, we would be able to attain an optimal level of unity in which the nonexclusive nature of this situation could be used to our advantage. Essentially, we deserve to be treated equally because under all these layers of society labels, personality and appearance, we are all human. </span></p><p></p>
