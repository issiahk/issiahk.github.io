                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; ">It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single, heterosexual man, in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife; or, if marriage and commitment terrifies him, a relationship with the opposite sex, of variable longevity (perhaps a one night stand). What is one such man to do, then, when women refuse their company, and fish swim away in fear? </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">ON THE SIMP</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The simp, a close relative of the incel, is a stock character on the stage of the world. In contrast to the incel, however, the simp wears many identities. A user of Urban Dictionary, Yovishi, describes him as a man who is seen as too attentive and submissive to women in the hope of receiving attention — in particular, when this endeavour fails. A friend of mine defines a simp as a man who actively demeans himself, as opposed to merely being attentive and submissive, in the hope of receiving female attention. (He noted that PewDiePie, Swedish YouTuber, also known as Felix Kjellberg, was not a simp. “[Kjellberg] is a man who respects and loves Marzia (his wife), but not at the expense of his own dignity”.) Yet another (slightly embittered) friend describes the simp as “one who acts in self-delusion, believing that acts of kindness and submissiveness lead to a betterment of treatment in a sexual or romantic experience”. Thus far, a general consensus. A simp is one who sets aside his dignity for female acknowledgement, perhaps acting under delusion or in denial. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Yet a widely circulated infographic (at the time of writing) posted on Instagram by Global Reform denounces the term “simp” as a misogynist, westernised noun denoting a “male who should feel shame in treating a girl properly or with kindness; in most cases the bare minimum”. This infographic proceeded to accuse such terminology of “discouraging males to show any ounce of respect or love within relationships especially”; “a way to shame males for being good, decent males” (sic). It claims that accusing men of simpery takes the walk to gender equality a step back because it adversly causes men to hate seeing females treated well (sic). Global Reform further asserts that while it may be “just a meme”, it reinforces the notion that males should not have to step down to show a women love or respect also bros before hoes (sic). </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">	What, then, is a simp? A pejorative callously thrown at those who do the bare minimum in respecting women, or a label for self-demeaning, attention-craving blockheads? </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">We will address this in the resolution. For now, we turn to the incel.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">ON THE INCEL</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The incel (a portmanteau of “involuntary” and “celibate”) is another stock character; lonely, unpopular, a prowler of the more sinister subreddits (the now-defunct r/incels comes to mind), perhaps emitting unpleasant odours. Self-described as desiring, though being in want of, a romantic or sexual partner, the life cycle of the incel is twofold. Seeing an object of his desire, he simps; his desire unfulfilled, he rages. Some skip the first stage altogether and simmer in a stew of resentment and loathing perpetually, fury fuelled by unsated longing and a denial of the power that woman, the root of all evil, the epitome of treachery, the embodiment of emotional weakness has on his poor tormented soul. (“Frailty, thy name is woman!” cries the involuntarily celibate Prince of Denmark in Act One, Scene Two of Hamlet.) The incel’s rage is a manifestation of aggrieved entitlement and the culmination of centuries of special rights and privileges conferred through the biological state of being male. Men still enjoy preferential status in virtually every realm — as Amanda Taub, a former human rights lawyer, states in her article On Social Media’s Fringes, Growing Extremism Targets Women — but the currents of societal change are beginning to erode the foundations of these rights and privileges. The socioeconomic landscape’s shift challenges the 4chan-prowling incel’s position; he slips and slides on the riverbanks of progression. Lilliana Mason, a social scientist at the University of Maryland, attributes the classic rage of the incel to this erosion. One may reasonably infer that their thoughts flow vaguely along the stream of we used to be in charge, and we are no longer the only ones in charge; we are being attacked. Mason continues that “if you have a sense that you’re owed, that your deserved status is being threatened, then you start to fight for it”. For the incel, this fight expresses itself in a bitter lashing-out against those who have dared to challenge the system of entitlement — the women who reject their advances. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">ON THE HARM BOTH DO TO SOCIETY</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The rage of the incel, though seemingly inconsequential — what need have we, a developed society, to pay attention to such hormonal whining? — can prove, and has proven, to have disastrous effects. A shockingly great number of involuntarily celibate men choose to collectively lament their woes on internet platforms, fantasising “of a social order that would grant them access to the women of their choice”. A wretched notion of liberation. In the early 2000s, these men mass-mourned on Reddit and 4chan, creating communities in which men blamed women for their celibacy, advocated occasionally for extreme violence — including murder and rape — and behaved in a deplorable manner generally misogynistic, occasionally homicidal, and often racist. This deplorability culminated in a series of barbarous mass murders and other violent attacks, committed by self-identified incels, in the last twenty years. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">	The lexicon inspired and used by the incel community, similarly, tends toward the dehumanising, vulgar, and racist. A “Stacy” is an attractive, sexually active woman; a “Becky”, less attractive; sexually active and attractive men, “Chads”. “Normies” are average non-incels. “Femoids” refer to the women who are the unfortunate recipients of their ire, and is often shortened to “foids”. “Roasties” are a reference to the labia minora; “mogging”, surpassing and eclipsing another in physical appearance; “looksmaxing”, attempts to improve one’s appearance. A “currycel” is an incel of South Asian descent; “ricecel”, an East Asian. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Overlooking the depreciation of a language, words alter thoughts and change actions. Dehumanising language leads to dehumanising behaviour. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">	In comparison, then, it would appear that a simp is far milder; his only crime is submission. Yet incel culture is such that simps, men who degrade themselves for approval, are often covert incels themselves. Additionally, classification depends very much on social status; a popular, attractive man who simps is not called a simp, but rather a Chad (see above: PewDiePie). The demographic for simps is limited. Usually, the only men outright accused of simping are those who match the incel stock character: introverted, friendless, outcast. Thus, the preliminary incel is a simp, though the simp may not be an incel. The difference lies in celibacy and its maintenance. If the simp escapes celibacy, his incel status is revoked. (The author would like to note that in general society, this does not earn him more respect.)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Anyone with a basic grasp of logical inference may conclude, and quite rightly, that our stock character, the incel — with no exception — must also be a misogynist; arrant knaves, all! This is evident. But what of the simp? Is the title of simp one borne by a man devoid of all self-dignity in pursuit of affection, as originally etymologied, or has it evolved into the pernicious pejorative flung at any and all men vaguely respectful in conduct?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">It can be suggested that the distinction — though it exists — need not be drawn. In reality, defining the simp as either the former or latter makes no difference in the behaviour that results: avoidance. The word, with all its negative connotations, is one that we seek to avoid; thus, a reversion to the opposite of its definition. Disrespect. Out of a desire to prove himself not a simp, to assert his individuality and affirm his stoicism (“Marcus Aurelius was no simp!!!1!!1!1!!!!1!” cries the willful male), a man veers onto the miserable road of derision and contempt, paving his way to inceldom. So it is that the simp encourages misogyny (and simply through existing, at that) despite initially appearing to be its antithesis. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">To conclude — in the words of yet another friend (the author has clearly done an extensive crowdsource) — “being a decent human being is fine”, and, indeed, sufficient. The identities of simp and incel are not exactly conducive to the excellent mental health we all desire, and we — as individuals — should strive to be neither.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">WORKS CITED</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">“Simp.” Urban Dictionary, www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Solon, Olivia. “'Incel': Reddit Bans Misogynist Men's Group Blaming Women for Their Celibacy.” The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 8 Nov. 2017, www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/reddit-incel-involuntary-celibate-men-ban.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Taub, Amanda. “On Social Media's Fringes, Growing Extremism Targets Women.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 May 2018, www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/world/americas/incels-toronto-attack.html.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
