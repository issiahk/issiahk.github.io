                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Recently, social movements have taken the world by storm. Whether politically or racially motivated, social unrest is more complex than is acknowledged. Philosophers and sociologists have tried to explain the origins of these movements with little success. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">“Revolution” refers to a popular uprising fundamentally changing societal structures. Historically, the lower classes revolt to gain more rights and better living conditions, rejecting the authorities, institutions, and ideologies they believe exist to oppress them. Nowadays, many of the movements start as peaceful assemblies which aim to state a certain belief or opinion, but once they’re met with disapproval or even aggression from the authorities, the pressure adds up  eventually evolving into violent movements due to a poor way of addressing community’s demands by the government.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Urban riots are generally associated with deprivation in the community. Once the people realize they are deprived from certain things and are aware of the changes that should be made in their community, the ideological clash arises. As Max Weber, one of the most prominent European sociologists, states: to understand the idea behind revolutions, we need to see why it is important for the individuals. Where does the revolutionary idea come from? Why is it important? According to Weber, there are four basic motivations for every human action: First, action is based on precedence and habit, which, in context of social movements, means how people perceive the idea of freedom and injustice. Effective social action is based purely on individuals’ feelings and attachments, as people only stand up for what matters to them, often without considering the future consequences, as this motivation is directed by rapid emotions. Third is value rational social action, which includes actions motivated by values and  beliefs, for example religious movements. Last is rational action, which comes from the belief that the ultimate goal can be achieved and the changes in the society are possible. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The external causes of riots, according to research on the 2013 Stockholm Riots (Holdo & Bengtsson, 2019), include low institutional legitimacy, resentment towards the authorities, lacking economic opportunities, desire for self-advancement and limited social control. Looking at contemporary issues such as “Black Lives Matter”, we can draw parallels between theory and reality. The movement regained prominence in 2020 after black American George Floyd, died from suffocation after a Minnesota police officer knelt on his neck for ten minutes. That incident has caused resentment towards police brutality to boil over. Furthermore, the delay in government response, and the original refusal to prosecute the officer for murder, fuelled distrust in the government. People decided to and demand justice. This mentality often excuses violence which often occurs during riots, as people are encouraged to unify with a single goal in mind and the collective aspects make it relatively risk - free (Holdo & Bengtsson, 2019). Since people become anonymous in the crowd, the sense of self - responsibility disappears. The behavior of individuals is influenced by the behavior of the group and “crowd wisdom”, which makes them lose their individuality and self awareness. They identify themselves with the group, and that mob mentality leads to experiencing fewer social inhibitions. Moreover, violators are harder to spot and therefore it is more difficult for the police to prosecute them. However, even if people get arrested during the protest, they are associated with the group and therefore the responsibility becomes collective. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Riots are rarely caused by one factor, but rather a general discontent with various aspects of the society boiling over. For instance, the Black Lives Matters movement, which has originally started in 2013, touches upon racial inequality, as well as economic and social inequalities. It delves deeper into racial divisions in the US, which has begun with prosecution of native Americans by the colonizers and later by slavery. It discusses the history of racial segregation and white supremacy in the United States, as well as points out all the changes which need to happen in the society to make it better, including raising awareness on African - American heritage and its role in creating the nation. Besides, it also voices out problems previously ignored by the administration, such as police brutality and lack of legislative efficiency in the country. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Similarly, as previously mentioned The Stockholm Riots of 2013, which erupted when a 69-year old Lenine Relvas - Martins was shot by the police in an immigrant community near Stockholm (Holdo & Bengtsson, 2019). The police officers later tried to cover up the death of the individual, which resulted in severe uprising in major Swedish cities. However, it also caused further divisions between the immigrants supporting the cause and the native Swedish citizens who thought of it as an unnecessary disturbance. It has resulted in broad discussions in the Swedish government over immigration policies and the future of minorities in Sweden. Generally supported by people </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Hearing about all these examples and examining the history of riots, one may start wondering whether revolutions are good or bad. Are they impactful, or merely disturbing?</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">According to various researchers, revolts are a natural part of history and a changing force in society.  While judging revolts, we should look from various perspectives and include the social and historical circumstances during which the riot had happened, as well as examining the importance of the cause for the individuals. While riots may inspire unity within marginalized minorities, it can also result in further divisions between the majority and minorities. They always cause change in the society, yet not always in the way it is expected or desired. For example the Stockholm riots which were supposed to end prejudice towards immigrants, but only caused further misconceptions and stereotypes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">By examining patterns which cause riots, we can become aware of deeper social contexts and problems, which may help us with understanding a particular society, it’s values and visions for the future. </span></p><p></p>
