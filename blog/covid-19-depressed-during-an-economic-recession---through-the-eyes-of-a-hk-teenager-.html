                <p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">The coronavirus. One of the world’s most top searched words, trending on Google, Instagram, Facebook and just about every other fact-finding site you can name. For many of us, it also trends on our minds. How long will this virus last? Will my education be affected? Will my job, my salary, be affected? These are some of the millions of questions and issues that numerous people are anxious about. Due to the coronavirus and international lockdowns, the economy has plummeted. Not only this, but being cooped up in our houses without much social interaction is not ideal for anyone; the collective mental health has been severely affected. Economic uncertainty leads to less spending in the economy, which in turn means more people will lose their jobs. This takes a toll on their mental health, and they may start to feel worthless. Research from management company Gallup highlights that one in five Americans who are jobless for a year or more have been or are presently receiving treatment for depression. These people may also resort to drugs, alcohol, and crime to cope with the effects of the virus and the subsequent recession.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">In Hong Kong, citizens have been facing a challenging couple of months - economically, socially and mentally - due to the political protests and the coronavirus. Thousands of businesses have laid off workers, or asked for staff to take months off without pay. For example, Cathay Pacific is requesting that its 27,000 workers take voluntary unpaid leave, or risk being laid off. A plethora of emotions are evoked from workers lacking job security. Clinical psychologist Cheung Tsz-Kiu from the Hong Kong Red Cross states: “Some emotional reactions to the epidemic are normal, but it depends on how these emotions develop. If they are not well-handled, they can develop into more severe mental problems”. If people are forced to stay at home by themselves rather than visiting places of leisure such as parks and restaurants, mental health issues may be aggravated. Moreover, therapists are dealing with limited resources, leaving people feeling trapped. These people have fewer ways to alleviate symptoms of depression, which include loss of motivation and sleep deprivation. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">I have studied economics. I believe that governments can help aid citizens affected by the virus socially and economically. Economically, they can provide stimulus packages granted to each citizen, including reducing taxes, increasing subsidies and spending on infrastructure, which will all increase aggregate demand in the economy as more citizens would have extra money to spend. On a social front, countries can provide online services with free entertainment, activities, educational courses and by making websites that advocate the importance of mental health - which is equally as important as physical health. Furthermore, countries can raise prices and increase indirect taxes on goods such as alcohol and drugs, to prevent addiction and further worsening of mental health. They can also give out food subsidies for people struggling to afford basic necessities, and organise food banks. We must also tend to our elderly, and governments may attempt to waive transportation fees and medical expenses for them. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">As a teenager living in Hong Kong and studying at an international school, I feel that this pandemic will shape us into open-minded, flexible individuals. Online school has affected our education, but this may be for the best, as we learn to adapt to it as technology advances and schooling goes through changes to teaching patterns. Nonetheless, I do not think technology is a substitute for in-person classes, which provide more personal assistance. Besides, not everyone can afford a laptop. I expect that in the future, exam questions will ask “Assess the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy and mental health”. When those students turn the page in tension-filled exam halls, they will recount the horror stories their relatives have reiterated one too many times. We are living through and creating history; it is not a paltry task. Our mental health may be sacrificed by long hours on screens and isolation, but we should make some time for ourselves to work on our wellbeing.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">To cope with the mental effects of the virus, individuals can indulge in self-care days, and enjoy the outdoors. Moreover, we should make sure we only trust information from reliable sources, to prevent the unnecessary stress of overly pessimistic news. Additionally, we should connect with family and friends online to prevent loneliness. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Society needs to embrace these new challenges and recognise the importance of remaining positive and adding structure to their daily routines so as to optimise their personal and mental states. These are unprecedented times, and we may have to adapt and accept this as the new reality. As Hearclitus said, “change is the only constant” and the coronavirus, like many challenges society has faced, will be overcome and no longer be Google’s top trending word.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Bibliography:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Smith, Noah. “How Bad Might It Get?
