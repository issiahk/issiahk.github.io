                <p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Often are we told to enjoy ourselves during the small gift we call our teenage years: go ask your crush out, attend that party, have fun at school and make new friends. In this short period of time, we develop character, instill morals and build relationships, ultimately preparing ourselves for the utopia known as adulthood. But what if I told you, within the same heaven we praise, millions of other youngsters are constrained in living hell. They are bullied to the point of suicide, barred from social interaction and threatened and rejected by the people they once called friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning etc.) refers to a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity and is used to describe anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender. The concept has been around since the third millennium BC. To put that into perspective, same-sex couples have existed long before writing was even invented. And yet in today’s supposedly modern civilization, hatred and mistreatment against sexual minorities has widened the divide in society and has left many powerless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Firstly, it has to be acknowledged that the community has progressed massively in terms of fighting for the right and freedom to love; however, in reality, whilst old problems were resolved, new ones arose. Back in the day homosexuality was listed as a “sociopathic personality disturbance”, and governments openly hung and shot homosexuals. Nowadays, numerous countries now have welcomed the LGBTQ+ with open arms, setting up foundations and laws protecting them. But as the saying goes, “there will always be resistance to change.” LGBTQ+ youth mainly face at least one of many issues: cultural or religious conflict, family rejection, laws and bullying. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">This article will look at these issues in four different aspects: Obstruction, Exclusion, Confusion and Cooperation. This aims at diving deeper into the roots of these problems, shed light on the many stories that have gone beneath the surface, and look at the future outcome of our next generation.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Obstruction</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">It’s fair to say that we’ve come a long way since the days of burning people on crosses and public beheadings, yet in most cases, LGBT members still face repercussions of many sorts, and are still disenfranchised as they are powerless in taking any action to change the world. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Recently Hong Kong's high court ruled that public housing should be accessible to married same-sex couples after a previous government ban was found to be unconstitutional. The case is one of many legal challenges tied to discrimination in Hong Kong that members of the LGBT community face. Cases like this aren’t rare though. Around the world, sexual minorities are still vulnerable to discriminatory laws that deter them from most basic commodities. In Tunisia, the government invoked the sharia law to silence gay rights activists, and in many Middle Eastern countries, homosexuality is considered a capital offense and people can still be stoned to death, a practice that dates back to ancient times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Stigmatization and scapegoating of LGBTQ+ individuals serve as a basis for exploitation and discrimination, as well as a bonfire to violent and homophobic response. Globally many right-wing and anti-gay groups control the media narrative, making it hard opposition for LGBT. Religious and conservative countries generally abhor any gay or transgender notions. It’s the fact that even if laws aren't enforced, their very existence reinforces prejudice against LGBT people, leaving them feeling like they have no protection against harassment, blackmail and violence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; "></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Exclusion</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">One of the major issues surrounding LGBTQ+ teenagers is the school environment. Outside of their homes, schools are the primary places for educating and socializing for young people. Schools can be challenging environments for students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, but they are often especially unwelcoming for LGBT youth. A lack of policies and practices that affirm and support LGBT youth—and a failure to implement protections that do exist—means that LGBT students continue to face bullying, exclusion, and discrimination in school, putting them at physical and psychological risk and limiting their education.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">A study conducted by the National School Climate Journal concluded that a large majority of LGBT students feel unsafe and left out at school. 85% of LGBT students have experienced verbal harassment. They are twice as likely as their heterosexual peers to have been physically assaulted, kicked and shoved. Around 46% say that their peers and classmates aren’t willing to interact with them and 39% of students are completely isolated at school. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Bullying directly translates to physical injury and emotional distress, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Boundaries like bullying make it difficult for LGBT youth to excel in school. Most LGBT victims of bullying aren’t able to keep up with their homework and have worse grades compared to their straight counterparts. It also makes it hard for them to view school as an enjoyable factor in their lives, with many not participating in any extra-curricular activities, and some even downright dropping out of school. Only 19 percent can “definitely” be themselves at home. But that’s not all.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Confusion</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">NBA champion and 13-time All-Star Dwyane Wade has had his fair share of moments in the spotlight, whether it was leading the Miami Heat to their first-ever championship in franchise history, or marrying Hollywood superstar Gabrielle Union. But recently, controversy has engulfed the Wade family over their support of their transgender daughter Zaya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union have publicly supported Zaya and spoken about acquiring information about her transition. Hip-Hop superstar Cardi B spoke about the controversy on her Instagram Live, backing up Zaya’s choice. “Let people find their happiness, especially kids, let them feel comfortable,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Although Zaya was welcomed by some, many were immediate in their harsh judgment and quick to hurl hatefulness toward her and her parents. Following the announcement, many celebrities displayed severe criticism towards Zaya’s decision and Wade and Union’s parenting. Celebrities like Rapper Boosie Badazz and Young Thug misgendered Zaya and implied that she was too young to have made such a decision. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Unfortunately, not many LGBT children have parents like Zaya does. Many transgender teens face prejudice and stigmatization over their life choices. Instead of others siding with them, they are turned against and are shamed by their own family. Psychological scars are left, and over time most teenagers are susceptible to mental health and self-esteem issues. LGBT youth have the highest suicide rates amongst all youth, 1 in every 6 students have considered killing themselves. And a study published in 2018 found that gender nonconforming youths are at even greater risk, with more than half of the transgender male teenagers attempting suicide over the three years they were followed.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Cooperation</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">After all that’s been said and done, it isn’t the end of the world just yet. Over three-quarters of LGBT teenagers say that they know things will get better. Organic change is happening and we have made massive breakthroughs, but there are still barriers that we must break down together. Now it’s our turn to help return the favour. Governments, schools, and society can all take part to change for the better.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Firstly, governments need to ensure the protection and validation of LGBT people. Instead of alienating LGBT, make them feel as if they belong to this world. Governments should be driving progress rather than seeking to entrench prejudice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">While comprehensive nondiscrimination protections won’t prevent all instances of discrimination, they are a critical way to hold homophobic opposition accountable. Additionally, they send the message that LGBT people are both accepted and respected by all levels of government. LGBT people deserve the opportunity to live full, equal, and authentic lives—and that won’t be possible while discrimination remains a looming threat to LGBT people and their families.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Secondly, schools can start off by promoting student collectiveness, setting up support groups and preventing bullying. A positive school environment is associated with less depression, fewer suicidal feelings, and fewer unexcused school absences among LGBT students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">There are lots of success stories from schools that have established LGBT groups and made policies that tackle bullying. Not only do their mental health and grades improve, but their lives as students were finally- they weren’t harassed or bullied, they attended all their classes, and most importantly they were accepted by their schoolmates and they had friends. LGBT youth should be able to enjoy their teenage years, through this we are able to give them that opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Last but not least, society as a whole can take that step forward in reducing homophobia and aiding LGBT members. Whether you recently found your child has doubts over their sexuality, or when you see someone being heckled because of their sexuality, step out; as people of this Earth who breath the same air and share the same common values,  we shouldn’t discriminate. Let us finally give them closure and the peace they deserve.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Conclusion</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; ">Imagine: a world where everybody gets along, people no longer separated because of their choices, families finally united and everyone lives happily ever after. While we aren’t far from making the dream come true, many obstacles such as laws, bullying and discrimination still prevent many from waking up to reality. If all parts of society band together in unity to help alleviate the situation, we can all finally live in harmony.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
