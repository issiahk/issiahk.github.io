                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Animal testing is a huge issue that is, unfortunately, largely ignored in society today. Nowadays people are blinded by the media. As the media usually ignores animal testing in favor of other more sensational topics, most people forget that it remains an important issue we have yet to tackle. Research by Cruelty-Free International and the Dr. Hadwen Trust suggests that an estimated 115 million animals may be used in experiments worldwide each year. In numerous countries such as China, it is mandatory for animal testing to be performed before the product can be sold. This prevents shops such as Lush and The Body Shop, that have been fighting animal testing for years, from selling their products in China. The fact that animal testing is still a requirement in some countries is extremely worrying as many countries, such as China, show no sign of changing that law anytime soon, and there are no organizations with enough influence and reach to compel these countries to change it. Luckily in Hong Kong, animal testing is not mandatory, so many stores, like Lush and The Body Shop, are able to fight the battle against animal testing.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">Fortunately, animal testing is not going completely unnoticed by larger organizations such as PETA - an American NGO that has been fighting animal testing for years now. Even though most of their work takes place in America, they also maintain a global presence. Some of the branches of their organization, such as PETA Asia, focus their efforts within their region so that they catch more cases of animal abuse and testing. This helps PETA to reach people around the world, increasing awareness and convincing citizens to fight against animal testing. PETA is lobbying for a legal framework to prosecute people who abuse animals. By bringing horrific cases of animal mistreatment to light, they aim not only to bring the abuser to justice, but to open people’s eyes to the scale and magnitude to which depravity against animals continues.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">In cruelty-free organizations such as Lush, their products are tested on human volunteers. Firstly, Lush employees test the product in their houses, to make sure that it’s ready for human testing. Then, the volunteers test it. The volunteers boast a wide variety of skin and hair types to account for genetic differences, so Lush can be sure that the product can be used by everyone. Following testing,  volunteers fill out an extensive questionnaire about the product. Then, the remainder of the product is sent back for microbiological testing. Lush employees make sure that the micro-organisms within the product are not harmful, and they also examine the yeast and mould that forms by leaving the product alone to see how long the product could potentially last. Lush, at the forefront of rejecting animal testing, organized a petition to ban the sale of animal-tested products in the EU. Thanks to Lush, this law was ratified in 2013. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The Body Shop is another pioneer  among cruelty-free organizations. They have been in the fight against animal testing since March of 1976. Their founder Anita Roddick was a British businesswoman, human rights activist and environmental campaigner. She created The Body Shop not only to make quality cosmetics products, but products that can be used without unethical animal testing being done. This was revolutionary at the time, as some people believed - and still do - that animals are below us. This belief is the root cause of why people test products on animals - even if it causes them excruciating pain, or even kills them. The Body Shop rejected this archaic way of making beauty products. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; ">The SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is an organization that helps with animal rights. It can be found in Hong Kong but many variations are situated worldwide. The SPCA in Hong Kong was founded in 1903, modelled after the original SPCA, that was founded in 1866 in New York City. SPCA International was founded in 2006. It was created to help countries without their own version of the SPCA. Even though they are the first charity in Hong Kong focused on animal welfare, they only get around 1% of their funding from the government. They fight to help animals because they believe that “animals are living creatures which like humans, are able to feel pain, hunger, and thirst. We should not inflict any suffering upon our fellow creatures just because they can't speak”. Right now, Hong Kong isn’t following in the footsteps of many countries in Europe, as the government refuses to  impose a blanket ban on non-cruelty-free products. This may be because the government is afraid of losing millions of dollars in tourism, as many people come to Hong Kong to buy these products, because they can’t be found in other countries.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; "> Animal testing dates back to the 3rd century BCE, when the Greeks used it to experimented on animals? Testing products on animals has been going on far too long - and it can and must be stopped. It is outrageous to think that today’s society, which prides itself on morality, kindness and tolerance, can allow such mistreatment of animals to continue unchecked. </span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; "> What can you do to stop animal testing? The easiest step is to buy cruelty-free products!  You as a consumer have power in choice, and a responsibility to make that choice count. Every time you purchase goods produced animal-cruelty free, it not only helps support that company and help it make more of its products, but signals to other companies on the fence that there is a demand for cruelty-free products. As well as this, buying products that aren’t cruelty-free you will essentially enforce the idea  that it’s acceptable for companies to test their products on animals. Buying cruelty-free products helps to spread awareness and enforce the importance of the issue, while also helping companies continue to fight animal testing! As well as this, use your voice and speak up. Download apps such as Beagle Freedom Project’s Cruelty-Cutter, which you can use to see if a product is cruelty-free just by scanning a barcode. There are also many charities that stand against animal testing - and funding them through donations is the first step in standing up against lobbyists and industry groups which seek to hamper animal protection. Lastly, volunteering is always an option. Stand with us against animal testing - and don’t forget to share this article!</span></p><p></p>
